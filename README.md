# Simpson Face Recognition using OpenCV and Deep Learning



A deep learning project that recognizes characters from *The Simpsons* using OpenCV for face detection and TensorFlow/Keras for CNN-based classification.

## 📌 Features
- Detects and classifies faces of Simpson characters (Homer, Marge, Bart, etc.).
- Uses OpenCV for preprocessing and Haar Cascades/MTCNN for face detection.
- CNN model built with TensorFlow/Keras for accurate recognition.
- Supports image inputs and real-time webcam detection *(if applicable)*.
